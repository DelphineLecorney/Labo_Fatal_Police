with police.

# Objective

Implementation of a data analysis solution:

Construction of a Data Warehouse according to a multi-dimensional model.
Implementation of an ETL that will allow the addition of new data in the future
data as it is added.
Exploit the new model and its data to develop reports to answer the questions
to answer the questions asked in the next slide.
These reports can be built using tools such as Power BI, Qlik, Sense, Tableau, or Python
Creation of an AI to predict potential new cases.

# Requirements

To help understand the global situation of fatal police shootings in the

# \*\*\*\* My Analys \*\*\*\*

First, I import the modules that I think are necessary for the analysis of the files, it's always possible to import others afterwards.

Then, I import the files with pd.read (pandas) that I want to analyze, I will first read them with the Sweetviz module which gives me a first overview on the data like missing data for example or distinct, nulls....

I'm doing a little info point to get my data type and target the nulls if that's the case. I get the number of columns and the number of entries.

I repeat the operation for the 3 files.

I then switch to SQL Server Management Studio to create my database which will contain my 3 files.
Once my database is done, I create a project on Visual Studio to store the raw data from my 3 files.
